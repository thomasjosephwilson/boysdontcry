            what do you think being masculine is?                
            <br>  <br>
        strong, and powerful?
            <br>                
            apathetic and stoic?
            <br>
            what about when you don't fit into those categories - what are you?
            <br>  <br>
            a faggot, a queer, a pussy and a bitch.
            <br>  <br>
            seemingly for nothing.
            <br>
            boys throw around these words for when they mean stupid, or dumb.
            <br>
            and these are extremely hateful words - and there are consequences.
            <br>
            boys internalize this -
            <br>
           they begin to believe that being homosexual or a woman is the worst you can be.
            <br>
            <br>
            i challenge you to stop saying these words.
            <br>
            <br>
           
            why do we say them, anyway?
            <br>
            <br>
            we aren’t innately born to act like a brooding man who hides his feelings,
 
            <br>
            we are socialized to do so.
            <br>  <br>
            this is a common pattern for most men — that’s why it’s apart of a system. 
            <br>
            it’s “tradition” to be a man.
            <br>
            it’s not your fault. it’s just what we know.
           
            <br>  <br>
            we continue to be socialized to push away all things that are feminine:
            <br>

            vulnerability, crying, emotions, softness.
            <br>
            we instead mask them, with the only socially acceptable emotion: anger.
         
            <br>
            and we call eachother faggots and pussies 
            <br>
to encourage everyone to hide the soft parts of themselves, too.
            <br>  <br>
            and we all know how anger effects the people around us —
        
            <br>
            but what about ourselves?

            <br>  <br>

        it's time to let it all out.
        <br>
